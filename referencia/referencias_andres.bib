   abstract = {Using a system generalized method of moments model, the present paper investigates the impacts of trade liberalization on employment in Vietnam from 1999 to 2004. The results show that the increase in industrial output increased labor demand, whereas the increasing wage rate led to a decline in the employment level. The impact of export expansion on derived labor demand was positive and statistically significant, indicating that the higher level of exports than previously presented employment opportunities for the country's large labor surplus. As far as imports are concerned, empirical observations indicate that imports did not necessarily negatively impact Vietnam's employment level. © Journal compilation © 2009 Institute of Developing Economies.},

@article{Jenkins2006,
   abstract = {This paper investigates the impact of international trade on manufacturing employment in developing countries, by undertaking a comparative study of four countries - Bangladesh, Kenya, South Africa and Vietnam. It does so by employing a variety of methodological approaches: factor content; growth accounting; and econometric modelling. The main empirical finding is that international trade seems to be associated with the net creation of jobs in Bangladesh and Vietnam, with female workers being the key beneficiaries. In contrast, international trade has been associated with adverse employment outcomes in Kenya, and possibly in South Africa. This suggests that there may be crucial differences between Asia and Africa in terms of the impact of globalization on employment opportunities in manufacturing. Some alternative explanations for such differences are offered in the paper.},

@article{Greenaway1999,
   abstract = {A large number of studies have recently attempted to evaluate the impact of trade on employment, many relying on either the factor content or growth accounting approaches. With some notable exceptions, this work finds limited evidence of strong direct effects but stronger effects through induced productivity changes. This study models the effects of trade on employment in the UK in a dynamic labour demand framework, on a panel of 167 manufacturing industries. We find that when we introduce trade, increases in trade volumes, both in terms of imports and exports, cause reductions in the level of derived labour demand. When we disaggregate by origin of imports we find stronger effects in trade with the EU and US compared to trade with East Asia. This provides supportive evidence for the idea that trade affects x-inefficiency, with the strongest competition for UK manufacturers coming from producers in the EU and US.},
